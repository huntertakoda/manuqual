Manufacturing Quality Data Analysis, of which the following key points can be made:

**Production Yield Percentage Quality:**

Product 001 and 002 had trouble in manufacturing, they were commonly struggling to make it over the minimum quality line, and commonly even under it.
Product 001, especially, barely ever made it over the minimum quality expected, which suggests that this product should especially be looked into.
+ Mar. 10 - Jul. 28 ; there was very little progress made for Product 001, where it had only a slight although steady rise while being multiple percent-points
+ - below the required threshold. Nonetheless, Product 002 at least had somewhat of a steady upward trend at this time-frame, although it then had trouble maintaining
  - that threshold, i.e. being above the minimum quality requirement.
Product 002 did, though, have a succesful period between about June 2 - Aug 25 before it went right back down to the minimum.
It then went up and down pretty frantically from August 28 to November, suggesting that the incosistency should be looked into.

Product 003, 004, and 005 all had steady lines far above the minimum threshold of quality, which suggests that these products' consistency should be used as a benchmark.

**Machine Maintenance Cost:**

The following machines had $1180-1336 maintenance costs (the highest) although they remained above the threshold for avg. yield percentage:

Machine's D4, E1, D2, and A3.

Machine B3 had trouble keeping a proper avg. yield percentage, only barely being above the threshold. It had the fourth highest maintenance cost.

($1,177 maintenance cost, 95.492% avg. yield percentage)

Machine's B1, C1, E3, and C2 all had similar maintenance costs but remained above the avg. threshold pretty well.

($1,155-$1,177 in maintenance costs per/machine)

Machine A1 failed to keep an avg. yield percentage above the minimum threshold.

($1,131 in maintenance costs, 94.704% avg yield percentage)

Machine A1 should be looked into since it has pretty high maintenance costs while failing to deliver proper yield percentages.

The following machines were between $1,129 and $884, with only Machine B4 being the standout which had $613.41 in maintenance costs & still good yield percentages.

Machine B2, E2, D3, C4, D1, C3, A2, E4, A4, B4

Machines with the highest yield percentages: 

Machine D4, E1, B1, C1, C3 and A4

**Defect Types by Severity and Cost**

Highest to lowest rework costs:
1. Material Flaw ($188,190)
2. Surface Defect ($157,079)
3. Finish Problem ($149,097)
4. Assembly Error ($127,875)
5. Alignment Issues ($104,246)
6. Dimension Error ($96,794)
7. Oversized (disproportionately less than the rest at only $1250 in rework costs)

Most critical defects:
1. Surface Defect (89)
2. Material Flaw (68)
3. Dimension Error (65)
4. Finish Problem (56)

**Total Quality-Related Costs Over Time**

$147,128 in maintenance costs between March and August. 

$351,278 in maintenance costs between August and October.

$56,571 in maintenance costs in November.
