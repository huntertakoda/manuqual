Manufacturing Quality Data Analysis, of which the following key points can be made:

**CORE POINTS OF ANALYSIS**

**Product 001 and 002 have a problematic average yield percentage.**

Product 001 and 002 are the stand-out problem. Identification of the product should be done, and this information should be relayed to the manufacturing manager.

The manufacturing manager could cause a sudden blast in quality by tweaking the quality, presumably through talking with operators & checking out machines.
(Machines will be addressed soon.)

Product 003, 004 and 005 all had success in reaching the average yield percentage required. This success should also be relayed to the proper person so they can utilize the success of these specific products as a benchmark for obtaining consistency with the others.

**Machine's D4, E1, D2, A3, B3, and A1, should be checked for problems.**

Machine's D4, E1, D2, and A3 should be looked into since they have the highest average maintenance cost across the months.

Nonetheless, Machine B3 and (especially) Machine A1 should be looked into since they had trouble & even failed (A1) to meet the average yield percentage threshold.

Other than that, the manufacturers should make sure that their building isn't pointlessly exerting overwhelming maintenance costs, presuming that any of these are considered 'a lot.' This is mentioned considering Machine B4 had approximately half the average maintenance costs of many of the machines.

Machine D4, E1, B1, C1, C3 and A4 & their respective usual operators should be used as a benchmark for quality average yield percentage outputs.

**Surface defects, material flaws and finish problems have the highest maintenance cost & critical error-rate, dimension errors has the third highest critical error-rate but second lowest maintenance cost. All should be discussed with the manufacturing managers.**

Surface defects, material flaws, and finish problems should all be properly looked into and talked about with the manufacturing managers since they were all in the top 4 of most critical defects, and each of them had the highest rework costs. Dimension errors, although only the second on rework costs, should still be looked into as well since it had one of the highest critical error rates, even beating out problems with finishing on products.

**March - August was succesful. August & October had a sudden double-fold in maintenance costs. The problem(s) should be identified, and discussed to prevent future patterns or problems of notably exacerbated maintenance costs.**

March and August were pretty succesful for maintenance costs - relatively, that should be used as a benchmark relative to August & October.

August & October should be looked into (i.e. what was happening on the floor in the manufacturing buildings) to identify what was causing a sudden double-fold in the maintenance costs despite being a notably shorter timeframe. This should be used to prevent or reduce future problems with sudden double-folds in maintenance costs as well as possible.

**Production Yield Percentage Quality:**

Product 001 and 002 had trouble in manufacturing, they were commonly struggling to make it over the minimum quality line, and commonly even under it.
Product 001, especially, barely ever made it over the minimum quality expected, which suggests that this product should especially be looked into.
+ Mar. 10 - Jul. 28 ; there was very little progress made for Product 001, where it had only a slight although steady rise while being multiple percent-points
+ - below the required threshold. Nonetheless, Product 002 at least had somewhat of a steady upward trend at this time-frame, although it then had trouble maintaining
  - that threshold, i.e. being above the minimum quality requirement.
Product 002 did, though, have a succesful period between about June 2 - Aug 25 before it went right back down to the minimum.
It then went up and down pretty frantically from August 28 to November, suggesting that the incosistency should be looked into.

Product 003, 004, and 005 all had steady lines far above the minimum threshold of quality, which suggests that these products' consistency should be used as a benchmark.

**Machine Maintenance Cost:**

The following machines had $1180-1336 maintenance costs (the highest) although they remained above the threshold for avg. yield percentage:

Machine's D4, E1, D2, and A3.

Machine B3 had trouble keeping a proper avg. yield percentage, only barely being above the threshold. It had the fourth highest maintenance cost.

($1,177 maintenance cost, 95.492% avg. yield percentage)

Machine's B1, C1, E3, and C2 all had similar maintenance costs but remained above the avg. threshold pretty well.

($1,155-$1,177 in maintenance costs per/machine)

Machine A1 failed to keep an avg. yield percentage above the minimum threshold.

($1,131 in maintenance costs, 94.704% avg yield percentage)

Machine A1 should be looked into since it has pretty high maintenance costs while failing to deliver proper yield percentages.

The following machines were between $1,129 and $884, with only Machine B4 being the standout which had $613.41 in maintenance costs & still good yield percentages.

Machine B2, E2, D3, C4, D1, C3, A2, E4, A4, B4

Machines with the highest yield percentages: 

Machine D4, E1, B1, C1, C3 and A4

**Defect Types by Severity and Cost**

Highest to lowest rework costs:
1. Material Flaw ($188,190)
2. Surface Defect ($157,079)
3. Finish Problem ($149,097)
4. Assembly Error ($127,875)
5. Alignment Issues ($104,246)
6. Dimension Error ($96,794)
7. Oversized (disproportionately less than the rest at only $1250 in rework costs)

Most critical defects:
1. Surface Defect (89)
2. Material Flaw (68)
3. Dimension Error (65)
4. Finish Problem (56)

**Total Quality-Related Costs Over Time**

$147,128 in maintenance costs between March and August. 

$351,278 in maintenance costs between August and October.

$56,571 in maintenance costs in November.
